Like a bad, bad dream  
We were washing our hands,  
We forgot our demands,  
And now we got a next chance

I woke up from a dream, where the people kept their distance  
Half the people working, Half the people were just bored  
Everyone afraid because a crippled health system  
Couldn't fix the issue when supplies were running short  
I knew while I was dreaming what on earth I missed the most  
It wasn't my employment or the trials or the cars  
From this ghastly dream remains all but a tiny ghost  
Reminding me which hopes I lost and which were just a farce

Like a bad, bad dream  
We were keeping apart,  
we made living an art  
And now we found our heart

I woke up from a dream, where the people kept their distance  
Half the people working, Half the people were ignored  
Everyone afraid, everyone hated the system  
From a place of privilege they barely could afford  
If they had not forced me awake I would have thought it real  
The money, credit, cops and all the methods to enforce them  
And I remember clearly, how important did it feel  
I'm wondering, how sick was our normal

Like a bad, bad dream  
We were washing our hands,  
We were making amends,  
And now we got a next chance
