It was nonbinary  
**they were nonbinary**  
Can I make it anymore obvious?  
It was a punk  
**they were also a punk**  
What more can I say?  
It wanted them.  
**They'd never tell**  
Secretly they wanted it as well.  
The attention was nice  
the opportunities burned  
**Love is a gift never returned**

Chords: F C Bb A

It was a synthie boi  
They said, "play your rhythms, boi",  
It wasn't good enough for them  
They had guitar teachers,  
while it had the sound features  
but you need more skills for a baaaaand

After a year,  
I walk away  
have too much ants in my pants to stay  
hungry for love,  
attention and fame  
can't find enough lovers for my game.  
I turn on TV,  
guess who I see  
Synthie boi's rocking up MTV  
I download it crying  
from the pirate bay site  
To hear its voice one last time

Phant was a synthie boi  
They said, "play your rhythms, boi",  
It was too avantgarde for M  
They had guitar teachers,  
while it had the sound features  
but you need more skills for a baaaaand

Chords: D F C Bb/A

Everyone says what I should do  
my voice is playback autotune  
The beats are made by some program  
And my ghostwriter sounds like M  
My whole life has become too loud  
I hope you stand here in the crowd  
cause all the fans that I now have  
don't fill the emptiness you left

Phant was a synthie boi  
They said, "play your rhythms, boi",  
It was too avantgarde for them  
M had guitar teachers,  
while Phant had the sound features  
you don't need any skills for a baaaaand

<!--
I don't know how this all went  
suddenly fame without a band  
My label pays my booze and rent  
My life has gotten out of hand  
Someone knows me from back then  
But I don't recall his name  
Do they really want to help,  
or do they want a piece of cake  
-->
