# _infected

Surfing on Windows
oh that funny browser game
I wanna be infected, baby
no sex education, no protection
no adblocker, no regrets
I wanna be infected, baby

security features gather data over you
who knows what all that proprietary software is doing
they want my phone number, they want my fingerprint
faceID works on corpses as well
security is control - and they control me

now I'm part of a botnet, now I'm infected
part of a sleeper cell
hacktivists use my device for brute force attacks
against the tech giants which surveill me
I don't even know I'm part of the revolution
