Mary did you know that your baby boy  
abused somebody's daughter?  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
's belonging to the other?  
Did you know, that your baby boy  
ignored somebody's "No"  
A child you did deliver  
A man you must let go

Mary did you know that your baby girl  
is shadowed by a sinner  
Mary did you know that your baby girl  
is suffering through each dinner  
Did you know, that your baby girl  
drowns a fire inside  
And that it might destroy your family  
If the fire wouldn't hide

Oh, Mary did you know!?

And did you want to know?

The blind will see  
the deaf will hear  
when silence sings again  
so face the wolf  
and listen through  
the story of the lamb

Oh, Mary did you know that your baby boy  
is master of his actions?  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
ties knots into the fabric?  
Did you know, that your baby boy  
needs to hear a "No"  
Cause if you hold your little baby  
do you think that he will grow?

Oh, Mary did you know!?

And did you want to know?

Did you know, that your baby boy  
needs to hear a "No"  
Cause if you hold your little baby  
do you think that he will grow?
