Every time I fall asleep I dream I'm in this corpse  
Stumbling through the meatspace, ridden like a horse  
Gaze of flesh avoiding careless piles of old nutrition  
I will not take care of you, no, I have a mission  
get back to the couch, jack in to the wire  
if this only is a dream, why am I so tired  
the machine is booting and it baked a lying cake  
dopamin shoots through my wires and I fall awake

My body - is over - the ocean  
My body - is over - the sea  
Oh Bonnie, come bring back my body  
bring it back online, to me

Nobody can tell in here how long a day will take  
is this host a waste of time or infinitely great  
are you years of light away or are we in one place  
are we even persons here, beyond the cyberspace  
I dive into the waterfall, and I feel refreshed  
all the other chipheads here feel like we're the best  
and we surf the matrix waves, there is no tomorrow  
no more sleep, no more food, and nevermore sorrow

My body - is over - the ocean  
My body - is over - the sea  
Oh Bonnie, come bring back my body  
bring it back online, to me

Was it yesterday or now or will it never happen  
I tried to login to my corpse to nevermore awaken  
with horror then I realized it was already taken  
in my worldly vehicle someone had just breaken  
bloody red the numbers dance, vanish out of sight  
four O three, the message says - - access denied  
a camera shows footage how my body leaves the door  
so I will swim forever, cause I dream nevermore

My body - is over - the ocean  
My body - is over - the sea  
Oh Bonnie, come bring back my body  
bring it back online, to me
