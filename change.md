No, I won't chaaaange for you, my darling  
No part of me will die for you,  
because I know what's good for me and I know I'm not good for you  
and I ask you to be true,  
if you want the real me or just somebody you can use,  
for your hope that all is normal, for your boring fantasy,  
for your yearning to be free, wrapped up at the christmas tree  
so your longing is defused - for some timid love exchange  
I don't want you to feel strange - but I won't change, I won't change, I won't change.

for your fantasy of safety, for the yearning to be free,  
for hope that all is normal
