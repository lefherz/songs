On a little houseboat near the coast of dying britain,  
Alan hopes he finds a quiet home  
After data robbery you better stay well hidden  
So he joined a travelling commune  
Conny's busy cooking, as the others would leave over  
all the vegetables she fished out of the trash  
Conny's pissed because she's not a cook, she is a rover  
she'd rather leave the oven for the dash  
Quinn is really trying hard to make her feel esteemed  
So they tell a story 'bout their troubled past  
Quinn can't bring themself to say out loud how much it means  
to them, that people treat them well without being asked  
Fortunately there's one language everybody speaks  
Why live in a commune, if you can't be a little gay  
So Conny feels appreciated well enough at least  
Alan wonders if he will fit in, some day


Few days later Alan knows each corner of the vessel  
and remembers everybody's name  
Alan never was the person to avoid a hassle  
but now he learns some new rules of the game  
Once a day the boat commune is sitting in a circle  
Debates between Quinn and him are flawed  
Though he means it well and really doesn't want to hurt them  
He only knows the pronouns he was taught  
Ria sits by silently, she prefers to listen  
The others here already speak too much  
To keep her tongue in check is something she has learned in prison  
at least she also learned to curse in dutch  
When everybody's gone, Quinn needs to vent their anger  
That Alan doesn't know yet to behave  
Ria isn't happy, cause she heard what Conny gave them, but  
her anger is a mood she likes to save


When Ria goes to bed, Conny is already drowsing  
And Ria doesn't want to make a fuss  
Half asleep, Conny murmurs how she loves their housing  
Ria answers with a silent cuss  
Early in the morning, Conny tells her all about  
her Tête-à-tête with Quinn the other night  
Conny doesn't realize, until Ria storms out,  
for jealous eyes this isn't a good sight  
On Deck Ria finds Alan, who cleans the dirty railing  
and asks her "What is bugging you today?  
The thing with Quinn and Conny, I thought you two were sailing  
So why she doesn't keep this Quinn at bay?"  
Ria screams against the wind, with a driving rage  
Until she throws her hands up in the air  
"I don't want to keep her, if it would be one more cage,  
I guess it will just never feel quite fair!"


One day the last satellite, finally fell down the sky  
Heaven knows what angel it had crossed  
People think "the end is nigh", the boat commune just wonders why,  
they only know their connection is lost  
Quinn and Ria think about how they could get their signal back  
They don't get information anymore  
Conny is complaining all day, that she needs the internet  
So Quinn proposes leeching from the shore  
"If you would just stop leeching on to my relationship!"  
Ria's snarling and leaving the room  
The boat is not so big, and it's not easy to get over it  
The deck is the best place to fret and fume  
There comes Alan to comfort her, she needs someone to nuzzle  
"You don't feel like you fitting in their norms?  
We all are broken pieces and we still like to play puzzle  
What doesn't fit here, will not be conformed."
