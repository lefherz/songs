God is in the rain  
God is in the riot  
God is in the veins  
of people who are quiet  
Only if you need a shepherd  
be part of the herd  
God is in the flames  
of a burning church

Back in the day when Moses  
committed the first crime  
and brought his folk neurosis  
and laws they should live by  
and claimed it was the lord above  
and not the lord within them  
who made the rules from now  
he should just have been smitten
<!-- is this verse anti-semitic? oof I hope not -->

One day I dreamt of Joseph  
I know he dreamt as well  
when he was feeling hopeless  
down in the cistern's hell  
I dreamt one day I wear the dress  
that makes the outcast whole  
and that I may forgive them  
on the day I'm in control.

some roads don't go to Rome  
a donkey ain't a horse  
Jerusalem feels more like home  
and he don't show remorse  
they say he mocked a king  
and threw the merchants out  


Der zimmerer, der auf nem Esel nach Jerusalem einritt,
um sich über die Könige und Kaiser lustig zu machen,
und die Händler aus dem Tempel warf,
und dafür dann hingerichtet wurde,
aber um seine Ideen totzukriegen,
musste Paulus sie institutionalisieren
