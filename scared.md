# Scared to be a Singer

A			E		f#  
But I guess I'm just too scared to be a singer.  
  D                              E  
I hope somebody's weeping for my soul, because  
  b				   A  
I've never seen much more there than a hole.  
            Adim              D					b'  
and I'm too busy weeping for Allende, and the children born to Brexit,  
                      c#'  
and all the girls who never learned to read  
    f#				   D  
And if there was a problem which affects me,  
			E				A  
I would just return to books, pretending I'm not one to feel.

I guess I'm just too scared to be a rebel.  
I only see the stuff that I could lose, 
and never what they have already taken.  
I'm fearing for the frontliners of Hong Kong,  
those left in Exarcheia, and everyone who ditches her hijab  
I guess the revolution can be happy that it's not happening here,  
at least now it's not up to me.

I hope I'm not too scared to be an enby.  
sometimes I walk around just in a dress  
though I'm not sure at all it's for my best.  
And I could worry 'bout the german pronouns, about workplace applications,  
and what the fascists do when they're in power -  
but today I'm wearing lipstick and inventing a new word,  
and I know happiness is just a sleeveless shirt.

I'm suprised, but I am not too scared to sing.  
maybe I'm too scared to show my soul, because you know,  
it could very well turn out to be a hole.  
But rather I would listen to the songs of a prisoner,  
to Anne Frank, or someone who escaped military ranks,  
'cause if a soul is empty, what's there to sing about?  
My tears are only wept for people I have never met  
I always bring a glass, to capture tears when they're still wet  
and lock them up in lines, in a verse and in a metrum.  
So if you need a song, maybe to fill your soul with petrol,  
or to crush a hope, or to find out where you belong,  
for tears, a glass is just another prison to get out  
and tears are not afraid of being wrong.
