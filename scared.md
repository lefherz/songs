# Scared to be a Singer

But I guess I'm just too scared to be a singer.  
I hope somebody's weeping for my soul  
because I never see much more there than a hole.  
and I'm too busy weeping for Allende,  
and the children born to Brexit,  
and all the girls who never learned to read  
And if there was a problem which affects me,  
I would just return to books, pretending I'm not one to feel.

I guess I'm just too scared to be a rebel.  
I only see the stuff that I could lose,  
and never what they have already taken.  
I'm too busy fearing for the frontliners of Hong Kong,  
those left in Exarcheia,  
and everyone who ditches a false god  
I guess the revolution can be happy, that it's not happening here,  
at least it is not up to me.

I hope I'm not too scared to be an enby.  
sometimes I walk around just in a dress  
though I'm not sure at all it's for my best.  
And I could worry 'bout the german pronouns,  
about workplace applications,  
and what the fascists do when they're in power -  
but today I'm wearing lipstick, and inventing a new word,    
and I know happiness is just a sleeveless shirt.

I'm suprised, but I am not too scared to sing.  
maybe I'm too scared to show my soul, because you know,  
it could very well turn out to be a hole.  
But rather I would listen to a prisoner,  
to Anne Frank,  
or someone who escaped military ranks,  
'cause if a soul is empty, what's there to sing about?  
My tears are only wept for people I have never met  
I always bring a glass, to capture tears when they're still wet  
and lock them up in a metrum-verse-corsett.
