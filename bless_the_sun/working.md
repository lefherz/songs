# _working

One day my phone will just stop working  
One day my phone will likely die  
I fear my soul will not stop hurting  
And I will weep until I'm dry  
My phone will never be recycled  
The corporation saw to that  
there won't be fixing nor revival  
I need a new one when it's dead.

One day my legs will just stop walking  
One day my legs will trip and fall
And neither praying nor deep talking
