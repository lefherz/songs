# Quit


You hate me for the thought you could quit  
That you don't have to take all the shit  
Don't force yourself again and again  
You don't have to be a man


and to this day I have no idea how the world sees me
the weird looks are just normal to me
I'm surprised when I realize it is not normal for others
to be looked at, to be othered
I don't even know why people look at me like this - is it the gender, the mask, the bare feet, the nerdiness, or the piercings and tattoos?
people say they care a lot for the first impression they make upon others
and I just have no way to know what exact part of me is weirding them out on first glance
I stopped caring a long time ago

I argued with people about constructivism for very long
and it's hard for me to accept when I'm wrong
because my whole life people assumed my gender doesn't exist
and every time I questioned their world
it felt like I had to defend my existence
so no surprise I fight to tooth and nail even in harmless discussions
because such a harmless thing as not understanding the world as constructed by intersubjective discoursive actions
translated to me as not understanding me as I am

I think they don't understand either what they hate about me
just as I feel attacked by their basic world view
they feel threatened by my identity, it undermines theirs
because all the violence we do to ourselves to fit in with society
I don't hide it, I turn my insides out
and this revolutionary act
threatens the hard-earned peace they made with patriarchy
the concessions they made to normal society,
the parts of themselves which they supressed
urge to come out as they see
how needlessly they were sacrificed
