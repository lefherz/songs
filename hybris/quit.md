# Quit


You hate me for the thought you could quit  
That you don't have to take all the shit  
Don't force yourself again and again  
You don't have to be a man


to this day I have no idea how the world perceives me
the weird looks are simply normal to me
I'm surprised when I realize that it is not normal for others
to be looked at, to be othered
I can't even tell why they look at me like this - is it my gender, the mask, the bare feet, the nerdiness, or the bad tattoos?
people say they care a lot about the first impression they make upon others
but how am I supposed to tell which exact part of me is weirding them out on their first glance
I stopped caring a long time ago

I argued with people about constructivism for very long
and it's hard for me to accept when I'm wrong
because
my whole life people simply assumed my gender doesn't exist
and every time I questioned their world
it felt like I had to defend my existence
that's why I fight to tooth and nail even in harmless discussions
because such a harmless thing as not understanding the world as constructed by intersubjective discoursive actions
because something as harmless as not understanding how nothing is god-given and everything can be changed
tells me you're not taking me as I am

I think they don't understand either what part of me bothers them
just as I feel attacked by their basic world view
they feel threatened by my identity, it undermines theirs
because all the violence we do to ourselves to fit in with society
I don't hide it, I turn my insides out
and this revolutionary act
threatens the hard-earned peace they made with patriarchy,
the concessions they made,
simply to belong.
the parts of themselves which they supressed
urge to come out as they see
how needlessly they were sacrificed
