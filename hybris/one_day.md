one day I go to prison  
one day they'll lock me up  
and I can sit here and fear for my freedom  
the little that I got  
one day I go to prison  
one day they take me in  
and I'm considering ceasing to sing  
but that would make them win

when I watched how the coal stopped moving into the coal plant  
I saw it everywhere  
I greet the Ohnmacht and fear like an old friend  
and I know my wounds and fatigue are a wide-spread trend  
Who doesn't want to make the cars stop rolling  
I experienced the power to make them stop  
and while I sing of anarchy, I can't deny the sacred part of me,  
that likes to play god

- Erste Strophe: traue ich mich, weiterzukämpfen?

- Zweite Strophe: ist Direct Action/Selbstwirksamkeit Hybris?
  - Ohnmacht, Angst, Trauma, Burn-Out

- Refrain: Liebe für alle, die ihr Leben in die eigene Hand nehmen?
  - Unser Trotz ist die Liebe füreinander?

they made me scared, they made me angry,  
they made me want to fight forever  
they see a danger in us -  
so let's be dangerous together
they tried to make me careful  
but I will just be full of care  
and every day I try to act  
as if they wouldn't still be there


- You made me scared, you made me angry, you made me want to fight you forever
  - what you made of us, we can remake
  - I can not see who I will be; but being unpredictable is what makes us dangerous
- Trauma shapes us; but we can not only re-shape the world, we can re-shape ourselves
- One day I will be different, one day I will be free. And I will love whoever I will become
