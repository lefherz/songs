# _deserter


not all humans are born equal, some are born to become more  
shill was such a child, though sickly, cute as all the children are  
first when shill got their first aug, the doctor said what it was for  
later no one bothered telling, when they got to fight the war  
shill was proud and pretty happy, implants made them well again  
and each contract brought some hardware, sponsored by UC-pay  
no more coughing, no more shaking, no more breaking, boon and bane  
but when shill asked all the questions, all they could was talk in vain


Are you really free? which part of you  
is intellectual property?


one day shill was on the streets, many people were that day  
people were quite angry, UC-pay took all their rights away  
everyone was wearing colors, only shill wore just the same  
as their fellow wage slave colleagues, uniforms of UC-pay  
shill could understand their anger, all the crimes filled quite a list  
when the shooting order came, shill tried really to resist  
but their arm was autonomous, lifts the gun, aim assist  
if shill had shot on their own, maybe bullets would have missed


shill was full of shock and fear, because their body had obeyed  
and they could not sleep, until the augs refused to stay awake  
nightmare followed nightmare, until they woke up just at eight  
and the dreams had made it clear, the feeling of control was fake  
one solution came up quickly, and they did not hesitate  
pull the plug and load a virus, crash the hardware full of hate  
when their comrades looked for shill they found some limbs from UC-pay  
shill had gone though, to make sure the corporation's debts were paid


shill's new comrades had forgiven what their limbs had done that day  
with their new-found family, shill could make the wrongs okay  
and each bombing, every sabotage gave them some justice back  
still there are more children with more questions born at UC-pay  
sometimes shill wakes up at night and feels what's missing in their limbs  
shill had never been complete, we all are missing tiny things  
but there is a feeling, that only desertation brings  
and there is the hope, that in the end only this feeling wins
